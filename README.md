# DevOPs Academy 2019 - Ansible Lab

This is a hands on introduction to Ansible.

## Tools we use
 - vagrant - to set up virtual machines where we can use Ansible for configuration management
 - virtualbox - vagrant is going to create vurtual machines using virtualbox (we could use docker or any other virtualization technology as well)

Installation

This LAB expects you are working on Windows 10. Of course these tools works fine in Linux as well.

 - go to https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and get vagrant 64bit for your OS.
 - same for Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Install them both and make sure theri binaries are in PATH.
So if you could call them without issues ...

To test them issue like e.g. https://asciinema.org/a/244379
